Semi-supervised opinion spam classification models in jupyter notebook. Includes:
- Self-training
- Co-training
- Label Propagation & Label Spreading
- TSVM
- Supervised classifiers to compare results


Code depends on the following packages that should be downloaded:
- https://github.com/tmadl/semisup-learn;
- https://github.com/jjrob13/sklearn_cotraining;
- sklearn (default python library).



Notebook files include importing data, preprocessing, training the model, evaluating with kfold cross validation and writing a report of the results to a text file.

Code can probably be written more clean and efficiently but this works
